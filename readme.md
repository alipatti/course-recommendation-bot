Carleton Course Recommendation Bot
==================================

Made in Spring '21 as group final project for CS 222: Natural Language Processing using a variety of web-scraping and natural language processing techniques.

Usage
-----
To rebuild the model yourself, download the entire repo and run `main.sh`. If you just want to use the bot, download `Chatbot.py` and `catalog.pickle`, and then run `Chatbot.py` with the two files in the same folder You might need to install a few dependencies.

Methodology
-----------
Course titles, descriptions, professors, dates, and more were scraped from the Carleton Registrar's website using the python library `BeautifulSoup` and stored in a `pandas` DataFrame. We then vectorize the course descriptions using `gensim`'s Doc2Vec model and use the cosine similarity of those vectors to make recommendations.

We chose dimension and window size for the Doc2Vec model by experimentally selecting values for which the similarity of courses within the same department was large. This method is heuristic, but we found that it produced subjectively better results than other things we tried. Put slightly more formally, we maximized the quantity
$$
    r = \frac{
        \text{mean similarity classes within the same department}
    }{
        \text{mean similarity of classes not in the same department}.
    }
$$
Code for this experiment is available in k-hell.py.

Hypothetical course titles are generated by a context-free-grammar which we wrote, and whose specification can be found in `titleGrammar.json`. We used the Python library `tracery`.
